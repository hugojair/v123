abstract: In this article, we describe the algorithms for causal structure learning
  from time series data that won the Causality 4 Climate competition at the Conference
  on Neural Information Processing Systems 2019 (NeurIPS). We examine how our combination
  of established ideas achieves competitive performance on semi-realistic and realistic
  time series data exhibiting common challenges in real-world Earth sciences data.
  In particular, we discuss a) a rationale for leveraging linear methods to identify
  causal links in non-linear systems, b) a simulation-backed explanation as to why
  large regression coefficients may predict causal links better in practice than small
  p-values and thus why normalising the data may sometimes hinder causal structure
  learning. For benchmark usage, we detail the algorithms here and provide implementations
  at {https://github.com/sweichwald/tidybench}. We propose the presented competition-proven
  methods for baseline benchmark comparisons to guide the development of novel algorithms
  for structure learning from time series.
