  a video prediction task – Insights from the IARAI Traffic4cast Competition at NeurIPS 2019

abstract: Deep Neural Networks models are state-of-the-art solutions in accurately
  forecasting future video frames in a movie.  A successful video prediction model
  needs to extract and encode semantic features that describe the complex spatio-temporal
  correlations within image sequences of the real world.  The IARAI Traffic4cast
  Challenge of the NeurIPS Competition Track 2019 for the first time introduced the
  novel argument that this is also highly relevant for urban traffic. By framing traffic
  prediction as a movie completion task, the challenge requires models to take advantage
  of complex geo-spatial and temporal patterns of the underlying process. We here
  report on the success and insights obtained in a first Traffic Map Movie forecasting
  challenge. Although short-term traffic prediction is considered hard, this novel
  approach allowed several research groups to successfully predict future traffic
  states in a purely data-driven manner from pixel space. We here expand on the original
  rationale, summarize key findings, and discuss promising future directions of the
  t4c competition at NeurIPS.
