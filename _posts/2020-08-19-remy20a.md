title: A Global Health Gym Environment for RL Applications
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2019 Competition and Demonstration Track
year: '2020'
abstract: This paper presents a platform for engaging in global health challenges,
  captured in the form of an OpenAI Gym styled environment. This platform has been
  used in three competitive challenges in 2019, and exposes a novel application domain
  for RL practitioners, along with the potential for significant social and scientific
  impact. While the platform has been demonstrated with problem formulations in global
  health, it is principally designed to facilitate general learning from simulation
  in a more abstract manner.
