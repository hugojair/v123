abstract: "  Sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods is a major
  obstacle for their use in real-world applications.  In this work, we show how human
  demonstrations can improve final performance of agents on the Minecraft minigame
  ObtainDiamond with only 8M frames of environment interaction.  We propose a training
  procedure where policy networks are first trained on human data and later fine-tuned
  by reinforcement learning.  Using a policy exploitation mechanism, experience replay
  and an additional loss against catastrophic forgetting, our best agent was able
  to achieve a mean score of 48.  Our proposed solution placed 3rd in the NeurIPS
  MineRL Competition for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning."
