title: Catch Me, If You Can! A Mediated Perception Approach Towards Fully Autonomous
  Drone Racing
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2019 Competition and Demonstration Track
year: '2020'
abstract: 'Automated flight, e.g. first person view drone racing is a challenging
  task involving many sub-problems like monocular object detection, 3D pose estimation,
  mapping, optimal path planning and collision avoidance. Treating this problem, we
  propose an intuitive solution for the NeurIPS (2019) Game of Drones competition,
  especially the perception focused tier. We formulate a modular system composed of
  three layers: machine learning based perception, mapping and planning. Fundamental
  is a robust gate detection for target guidance accompanied with a monocular depth
  estimation for collision avoidance. The estimated targets are used to create and
  update the 3D gate positions within a map. Rule based trajectory planning is finally
  used for optimal flying. Our approach runs in real-time on a state of the art GPU
  and is able to robustly navigate through different simulated race tracks under challenging
  conditions, e.g. high speeds, confusing gate positioning and irregular shapes.Our
  approach ranks on the 3rd place on the final leader board. In this paper we present
  our system design in detail and provide additional experimental results.'
