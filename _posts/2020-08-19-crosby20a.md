abstract: Modern machine learning systems are still lacking in the kind of general
  intelligence and common sense reasoning found, not only in humans, but across the
  animal kingdom. Many animals are capable of solving seemingly simple tasks such
  as inferring object location through object persistence and spatial elimination,
  and navigating efficiently in out-of-distribution novel environments. Such tasks
  are difficult for AI, but provide a natural stepping stone towards the goal of more
  complex human-like general intelligence. The extensive literature on animal cognition
  provides methodology and experimental paradigms for testing such abilities but,
  so far, these experiments have not been translated en masse into an AI-friendly
  setting. We present a new testbed, Animal-AI, first released as part of the Animal-AI
  Olympics competition at NeurIPS 2019, which is a comprehensive environment and testing
  paradigm for tasks inspired by animal cognition. In this paper we outline the environment,
  the testbed, the results of the competition, and discuss the open challenges for
  building and testing artificial agents capable of the kind of nonverbal common sense
  reasoning found in many non-human animals.
