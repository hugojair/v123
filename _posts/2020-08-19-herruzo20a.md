  Forecasting

abstract: The increasing complexity of mobility plus the growing population in cities,
  together with the importance of privacy when sharing data from vehicles or any device,
  makes traffic forecasting that uses data from infrastructure and citizens an open
  and challenging task. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to deal with
  predictions of volume, speed and main traffic direction, in a new aggregated way
  of traffic data presented as videos. Our approach leverages the continuity in a
  sequence of frames, learning to embed them into a low dimensional space with an
  encoder and making predictions there using recurrent layers, ensuring good performance
  through an embedded loss, and then, recovering back spatial dimensions with a decoder
  using a second loss at a pixel level. Exogenous variables like weather, time and
  calendar are also added in the model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling
  approach for sequences that ensures diversity when creating batches, running in
  parallel to the optimization process.
