abstract: 'Autonomous drone racing is a challenging research problem at the intersection
  of computer vision, planning, state estimation, and control.  We introduce AirSim
  Drone Racing Lab, a simulation framework for enabling fast prototyping of algorithms
  for autonomy and enabling machine learning research in this domain, with the goal
  of reducing the time, money, and risks associated with field robotics.  Our framework
  enables generation of racing tracks in multiple photo-realistic environments, orchestration
  of drone races, comes with a suite of gate assets, allows for multiple sensor modalities
  (monocular, depth, neuromorphic events, optical flow), different camera models,
  and benchmarking of planning, control, computer vision, and learning-based algorithms.  We
  used our framework to host a simulation based drone racing competition at NeurIPS
  2019. The competition binaries are available at our github repository {https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim-NeurIPS2019-Drone-Racing}. '
