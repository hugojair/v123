abstract: 'We present the design and results of recent competitions in Automated Deep
  Learning (AutoDL). In the AutoDL challenge series 2019, we organized 5 machine learning
  challenges: AutoCV, AutoCV2, AutoNLP, AutoSpeech and AutoDL. The first 4 challenges
  concern each a specific application domain, such as computer vision, natural language
  processing and speech recognition. At the time of March 2020, the last challenge
  AutoDL is still on-going and we only present its design.  Some highlights of this
  work include: (1) a benchmark suite of baseline AutoML solutions, with emphasis
  on domains for which Deep Learning methods have had prior success (image, video,
  text, speech, etc); (2) a novel any-time learning framework, which opens doors for
  further theoretical consideration; (3) a repository of around 100 datasets (from
  all above domains) over half of which are released as public datasets to enable
  research on meta-learning; (4) analyses revealing that winning solutions generalize
  to new unseen datasets, validating progress towards universal AutoML solution; (5)
  open-sourcing of the challenge platform, the starting kit, the dataset formatting
  toolkit, and all winning solutions (All information available at {autodl.chalearn.org}).'
