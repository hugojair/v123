abstract: 'Machine learning competitions have grown in popularity and impact over
  the last decade, emerging as an effective means to advance the state of the art
  by posing well-structured, relevant, and challenging problems to the community at
  large. Motivated by a reward or merely the satisfaction of seeing their machine
  learning algorithm reach the top of a leaderboard, practitioners innovate, improve,
  and tune their approach before evaluating on a held-out dataset or environment.
  The competition track of NeurIPS has matured in 2019, its third year, with a considerable
  increase in both the number of challenges and the diversity of domains and topics.
  Demonstrations offer a complementary dimension to the competitions, focusing on
  areas of machine learning which are either human interactive or demonstrable in
  some way, for instance robotics applications or generative models.  This volume
  is a compilation of selected papers associated with the NeurIPS 2019 Demonstration
  and Competition Track. The scope of the volume includes the design of the competitions,
  analysis of the results, novel methodologies developed to respond to the competitionsâ€™
  challenges, and the design and development of creative demonstrations. '
