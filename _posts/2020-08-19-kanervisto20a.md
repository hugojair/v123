title: Playing Minecraft with Behavioural Cloning
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2019 Competition and Demonstration Track
abstract: MineRL 2019 competition challenged participants to train sample-efficient
  agents to play Minecraft, by using a dataset of human gameplay and a limit number
  of steps the environment. We approached this task with behavioural cloning by predicting
  what actions human players would take, and reached fifth place in the final ranking.
  Despite being a simple algorithm, we observed the performance of such an approach
  can vary significantly, based on when the training is stopped. In this paper, we
  detail our submission to the competition, run further experiments to study how performance
  varied over training and study how different engineering decisions affected these
  results.
