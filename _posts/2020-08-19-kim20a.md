abstract: In the MicroNet Challenge 2019, competitors attempted to design the neural
  network architecture with fewer resource budgets, e.g., the number of parameters
  and FLOPS. In this study, we describe the approaches of team KAIST, using which
  they won the second and third places, respectively, in the CIFAR-100 classification
  task in the contest. We solve the task into four steps. First, we design a novel
  baseline network appropriate for the CIFAR-100 dataset. Second, we train this network
  using our novel structural regularization methods, which penalize the orthogonality
  of weights and replace the ground-truth label of each data with a noise vector that
  has class-wise similarity information from the representative feature vectors of
  each class in the course of training. Third, we seek the most potent data-augmentation
  methods for significant improvements in accuracy. At last, we perform the sparse
  training via a pruning technique. Our final score is 0.0054, which represents 370x
  improvements over the baseline for the CIFAR-100 dataset. This is the only work
  that finished in the top 10 percent of both parameter storage and computation over
  the CIFAR-100 classification task. The source code is at {https://github.com/Kthyeon/}micronet_neurips_challenge.
