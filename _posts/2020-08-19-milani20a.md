title: Retrospective Analysis of the 2019 MineRL Competition on Sample Efficient Reinforcement
  Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the NeurIPS 2019 Competition and Demonstration Track
year: '2020'
abstract: To facilitate research in the direction of sample efficient reinforcement
  learning, we held the MineRL Competition on Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning
  Using Human Priors at the Thirty-third Conference on Neural Information Processing
  Systems (NeurIPS 2019). The primary goal of this competition was to promote the
  development of algorithms that use human demonstrations alongside reinforcement
  learning to reduce the number of samples needed to solve complex, hierarchical,
  and sparse environments. We describe the competition, outlining the primary challenge,
  the competition design, and the resources that we provided to the participants.
  We provide an overview of the top solutions, each of which use deep reinforcement
  learning and/or imitation learning. We also discuss the impact of our organizational
  decisions on the competition and future directions for improvement.
