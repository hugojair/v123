abstract: 'Drone racing has become one of the challenging topics in robotics and machine
  learning because such a drone requires to equip with high performing modules that
  carry out demanding tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, mapping, and planning. In
  addition, one of the most crucial aspects of the racing drone is its speed. However,
  this is the somewhat less studied area compared to conventional topics such as obstacle
  avoidance and path-finding, probably because designing a loss function for the speed
  optimization with the gradient-based method is difficult. In this paper, we propose
  an evolutionary scheme for optimizing the speed-related parameters for shortening
  the travel time rather than using the gradient-based loss for them. For the planning
  part, we use an online learning method with the racing parameter optimization. Therefore,
  our approach is to combine evolutionary algorithms for speed optimization and gradient-based
  online learning, achieving first place in Tier 2 and Tier 3 in Game of Drones competition
