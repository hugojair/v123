abstract: There is a growing recognition that artists use valuable ways to understand
  and work with cognitive and perceptual mechanisms to convey desired experiences
  and narrative in their created artworks. This paper documents our attempt to computationally
  model the creative process of a portrait painter, who relies on understanding human
  traits (i.e., personality and emotions) to inform their art. Our system includes
  an empathic conversational interaction component to capture the dominant personality
  category of the user and a generative AI Portraiture system that uses this categorization
  to create a personalized stylization of the user’s portrait. This paper includes
  the description of our systems and the real-time interaction results obtained during
  the demonstration session of the NeurIPS 2019 Conference.
