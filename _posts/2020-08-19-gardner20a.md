abstract: Reconnaissance blind chess (RBC) is a chess variant in which a player cannot
  see her opponentâ€™s pieces but can learn about them through private, explicit sensing
  actions.  The game presents numerous research challenges, and was the focus of a
  competition held in conjunction with of the 2019 Conference on Neural Information
  Processing Systems (NeurIPS).  The 22 bots that played in the tournament leveraged
  a diverse set of algorithms, including variations of multi-state tracking, piece-wise
  probability estimation, Gibbs sampling, bandit algorithms, tree search, counterfactual
  regret minimization (CFR), deep learning, and others.  None of the algorithms of
  which we are aware converges to an optimal strategy. Top algorithms generally incorporated
  sensing strategies that successfully minimized uncertainty (as measured in the number
  of possible opponent states).  The top two approaches reduced this raw uncertainty
  metric less than some others.  Successful strategies sometimes defied conventional
  wisdom in chess, as evidenced by deviations between win rate and aggregate move
  strength as assessed by the leading available chess engine.
